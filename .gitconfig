	# `git pull` is basically a `git fetch` (retrieve commits from a remote
	# repo) followed by merging those commits with the local tree.
	#
	# A fast-forward "merge" is if you had A -> B and the remote had A -> B
	# -> C, then your local branch would be changed to point at C. A simple
	# integration of histories.
	#
	# Here we try and do fast-forward merges only or stop if they can't and
	# let the user decide. At this point the user could rebase their
	# changes on top of those from the remote, creat a merge commit, or
	# something else.
